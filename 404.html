      // this file is a workaround for the issue with vite and react-router-dom
      
      // the issue is that when you refresh the page on a route other than the root route
      // the browser will try to fetch the file from the server and it will not find it
      // so we need to redirect the user to the root route and let react-router-dom handle the routing

      // for example the path /project/about will be redirected to /project
      // and react-router-dom will handle the routing to the about page

      // Get the base path
      var basePath = location.pathname.split("/").slice(0, -1).join("/");

      // Parse the URL parameter
      var url = location.href;
      var path = url.split(basePath)[1];

      // Redirect to the path
      location.replace(location.origin + basePath + path);
